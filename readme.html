<p><b>Notes</b>
   <ul>
	   <li>Delete Filter</li>
            <ul>
               <li>The first priority while deleting a filter is given to the name. If a filter is having name "51" and another filter having ID 51 then the filter with the name "51" will be deleted</li>
           </ul>
       <br>
       <li>Update Filter IP</li>
            <ul>
               <li>For type Source, the input is expected in the source_ip parameter</li>
               <li>For type Destination, the input is expected in the destination_ip parameter</li>
               <li>For type Source or Destination, the input is expected in the source_or_destination_ip parameter</li>
               <li>For type Unidirectional Flow and Bidirectional Flow, the input is expected in both source_ip and destination_ip parameters</li>
               <li>The input should be in JSON (list of the list) format. Eg. ([["X.X.X.X"],["X.X.X.X/X.X.X.X"],["X.X.X.X/Y"]]) where X = 0-255 and Y = 1-32</li>
           </ul>
       <br>
       <li>Update Filter MAC</li>
            <ul>
               <li>For type Source, the input is expected in the 'source_mac' or in 'administration'. First preference is given to the 'source_mac' parameter</li>
               <li>For type Destination, the input is expected in the 'destination_mac' or in 'administration' and 'destination_address' parameters. First preference is given to the 'destination_mac' parameter</li>
               <li>For type Source or Destination, the input is expected in the source_or_destination_mac parameter</li>
               <li>For type Unidirectional Flow and Bidirectional Flow, the input is expected in both source_mac and destination_mac parameters</li>
               <li>The input should be in JSON (list of the list) format. Eg. ([["X-X-X-X-X-X"],["Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y"]]) where X = 00-FF and Y = 00-FF</li>
           </ul>
       <br>
       <li>Update Filter Port</li>
            <ul>
               <li>For type Source, the input is expected in the source_port parameter</li>
               <li>For type Destination, the input is expected in the destination_port parameter</li>
               <li>For type Source or Destination, the input is expected in the source_or_destination_port parameter</li>
               <li>For type Unidirectional Flow and Bidirectional Flow, the input is expected in both source_port and destination_port parameters</li>
               <li>The input should be in JSON (list of the list) format. Eg. ([["X"],["Y"]]) where X = 1-65535 and Y = 1-65535</li>
           </ul>
